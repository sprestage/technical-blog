Hi folks. There isn't a lot to see here. I'm storing my blog on github so I can easily add and edit my technical blog as well as using Git as my CVS so I can conveniently store everything on Github.

In 2024, this turned out to be the best site for how to set up for and then create a Jekyll blog, https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-jekyll-on-a-mac-the-easy-way/#install-jekyll

Command to run blog locally:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

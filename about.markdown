    <p class="lead" style="color:sienna;">  I am a Web Developer with a
    passion for Ruby, Rails, and backend development. I have proven expertise
    in the development life cycle, designing, testing, and supporting software
    and hardware products. Specialized in UNIX environments, PostgreSQL, and
    APIs. I am proficient in JavaScript, AWS, and DevOps. I am happiest when
    deep in code or crafting from a command line.</p>

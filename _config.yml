# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: My Technical Blog
subtitle: A simple technical blog for the junior web developer.
author: Susan Prestage

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "url:"
  This was a series of technical challenges, observations, and instructions
  that I came across early as I was learning to be a web developer. Some of
  them are still useful for me today (2024), some are clearly written by
  the junior developer that I was and are not useful nor very readable.
  Once this site is re-published, I will re-write the olI posts and
  publish them anew, perhaps with the old posts shown as replaced.
